"""Problem statement
Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.
Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.
In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.
There are 2 choices in the menu:
Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.
Consider the choice and print the appropriate area."""
public class Solution {
    public static double areaSwitchCase(int ch, double []a) {
        // Write your code here
     double area = 0.0; 
     switch (ch) 
     { case 1: 
       if (a.length == 1) 
       { 
           double r = a[0];
            area = Math.PI * r * r; 
        } 
        break; 
       case 2: 
        if (a.length == 2)
         {
              double l = a[0];
               double b = a[1]; 
               area = l * b; 
         }
        break; 
        } 
        return Math.round(area * 100000.0) / 100000.0;
    }
